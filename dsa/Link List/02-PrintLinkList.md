# understand the problem
    1. create a linked list with nodes.
    2. store some data in a node
    3. print all the node values in order.
# think algorithmically 
    1. start at the head of the linked list.
    2. if the current node is not `None`:
        * print the data of the current node.
        * move tho next node.
   
    3. repeat step 2 until the current node is `None` (end of list).
    4. stop
